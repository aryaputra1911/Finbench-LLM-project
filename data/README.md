# Finbench-LLM Data Directory Documentation

This directory serves as the centralized storage for all datasets utilized within the Finbench-LLM project. It is structured to handle high-volume financial data, vector indices, and model outputs efficiently.

> **Note on Storage Strategy:** Large-scale binary files, including original PDF documents, vector database indices, and raw JSONL datasets, are excluded from this repository via `.gitignore` to maintain optimal repository size and ensure high performance.

## Directory Structure and Governance

The data pipeline follows a strict hierarchy from ingestion to evaluation:

| Directory | Description | Repository Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `raw/` | Original financial statements (10-K, 10-Q) in PDF format. | Excluded |
| `processed/` | Sanitized text and canonical CSVs for fundamental audit. | Excluded |
| `database/` | Local Vector Store (ChromaDB) for RAG operations. | Excluded |
| `results/` | Model evaluation outputs and Epistemic JSON reports. | Included |
